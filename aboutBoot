    <p>So, you want to learn a little about me? You came to the right place. I'm shy, quiet, and ___________. Hey, wait that doesn't like what you wanted to hear. Even though I'm those things I also like to have fun and work hard. I'm expanding my skill set each and every day. I'm excited to take on greater challenges whatever they may be. As I've gotten older I've gone through multiple jobs. My favorite was roofing however it was taking to much of a toll on my body. Roofing has taught me the most about being a hard worker and never to give up. I also enjoy sitting down and working with computers. With that said, In the summer (2016) I will begin working on getting my degree in computing from Florida State College at Jacksonville. In hopes that I can get a job at an awesome company doing the work that I enjoy. When I pass that challenge it will be one of my greatest accomplishments. I'm trying to perfect my skills of creating creative, appealing, usable, websites using the latest W3C web standards guidelines and everything I learned about web development. Currently, I'm teaching myself, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and photo editing for web development. When I'm not in front of my computer studying design and development. You'll find me in front of my computer practicing my digital drawing or on my sofa drawing with a pen and paper, writing(I have written a couple of small articles). I'm trying to get some of my writing published, too. I'm also a huge gamer. Presently I live in Jacksonville, FL. I love to travel, read, study, and volunteering.</p>

       <blockquote class="steveJobs">"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."

    <div class="container">
        <ul class="accordion css-accordion">
        <li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item1" />
          <label for="item1" class="accordion-item-hd">1. What is your greatest failure, and what did you learn from it? <span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">
            
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item2" />
          <label for="item2" class="accordion-item-hd">2. What's the most difficult decision you've made in the last two years and how did you come to that decision?<span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. Be clear about why you are interested in the job and the value you can bring to their organization.

          Sample Answer: “I’ve applied to companies where I know I can get excited about what the company does.  Your company is one of my top choices.  This job is really attractive to me because it combines my interest and experience in logistics and security with work in a more global business environment.”</div>
        </li>
        <li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item3" />
          <label for="item3" class="accordion-item-hd">3. What are your career goals and where do you see yourself five years from now? <span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">The key here is to focus on your achievable objectives and what you are doing to reach those objectives.
          Sample Answer: “Within 5 years, I would like to become the very best mechanic your company has on staff. I want to work toward becoming the expert that others rely on. Hopefully, this will allow me to take on greater responsibilities with the company if the opportunity arises. I am also working towards additional certifications in the field to enhance my career potential.”</div>
        </li>
          <li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item4" />
          <label for="item4" class="accordion-item-hd">4. Why are you leaving your current job?<span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">When answering this question, always focus on the positive:  You are looking for a new challenge, more responsibility, more experience or a change of environment.  Never be negative about your former or current employers or talk about negative experiences you had there.

          Sample Answer: “I feel that the time is right for me to transition the outstanding skills and experience I obtained during my last four years in the military to the civilian job market. I received great training and/or education in the Army and have been given job assignments that have enhanced my technical skills, leadership ability and taught me how to meet deadlines and multi-task in a very fast-paced and often stressful environment. I can bring these same skills to your organization.” </div>
        </li><li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item5" />
          <label for="item5" class="accordion-item-hd">5. What are your strengths?<span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">This is one question that you know you are going to be asked so be prepared! Concentrate on discussing your main strengths. List three or four proficiencies such as your ability to learn quickly, determination to succeed, positive attitude, your ability to relate to people and achieve a common goal, etc.

          Sample Answer: “I have very good organizational and time management skills, but my greatest strength is my ability to effectively handle multiple projects and deadlines.”

          Sample Answer: “My strength is my flexibility to handle change. As a front line manager at my last job, I was able to turn around a negative working environment and develop a very supportive and productive team.” </div>
        </li><li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item6" />
          <label for="item6" class="accordion-item-hd">6. What are your weaknesses or areas you would like to improve?<span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">This is another frequently asked question.  Everyone has weaknesses, but when answering this question in a job interview, stay away from personal qualities and focus on professional traits. Describe what steps you taken to overcome your weaknesses so that you can demonstrate areas of improvement.

          Sample Answer: “I am always working on improving my communications skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters which I find very helpful.”

          Sample Answer: “Sometimes I have trouble delegating duties to others. This has sometimes backfired because I’d end up with more work than I could handle.  I’ve since taken courses in time management and learned more effective delegation techniques and I’m happy to say that my last several team projects were a great success.”</div>
        </li><li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item7" />
          <label for="item7" class="accordion-item-hd">7. Who was your favorite manager and why?  
What do you think of your previous boss? <span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">Do your research and know your bottom line. Research the industry standard for the positions you are applying for in your geographic area. Whenever possible, try to defer the salary question on the first interview so that you don’t under or over sell yourself.  If pressured, be prepared to give the employer a salary range.

          Sample Answer: “I’m sure that your company offers a fair, competitive salary for someone with my education / training, skills and experience. I am also willing to negotiate for the right position.”

          Sample Answer: “I will need more information about the job and the responsibilities before we can discuss salary, but it would be great if you could give me an idea of the salary range you have budgeted for this position.” </div>
        </li>
          <li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item8" />
          <label for="item8" class="accordion-item-hd">8. Have you ever had a conflict with a superior or colleague? How did you handle it?<span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">Almost everyone has been in this situation.  If you say no, intervieweres will usually dig deeper until you can give then an answer.  The key is to show how you reacted to the conflict and what you did to resolve it.

          Sample Answer: “I think that everyone at some point has had a conflict at work whether it’s with a supervisor or co-worker. I’ve found that when I’m in a difficult situation, it helps to communicate with the other person, understand their perspective and try to work out a collaborative solution whenever possible.”</div>
        </li>
          <li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item9" />
          <label for="item9" class="accordion-item-hd">9. What do you like to do?<span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">Be prepared for this question because this answer will sell your story. Know clearly what you bring to the organization such as your knowledge, skills, experience, education/training and personal qualities that demonstrate why you are the best person for the job. Be able to show how you add value to the company. Always qualify your answers with quantifiable results you have achieved in previous jobs or assignments. This will add tremendous credibility!

          Sample Answer: “I think I am a great match for this position. My degree in management coupled with more than 10 years of experience managing 100+ employees and delivering top notch training, helped me to improve staff productivity by 30% and reduce employee turnover. I believe that I can do the same for your organization and would be a great addition to your team.”</div>
        </li>
          <li class="accordion-item">
          <input class="accordion-item-input" type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="item10" />
          <label for="item10" class="accordion-item-hd">10. There's no right or wrong answer, but if you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be? <span class="accordion-item-hd-cta">&#9650;</span></label>
          <div class="accordion-item-bd">Always be prepared to ask the interviewer a few questions as well. This helps to demonstrate your preparation and interest.

          Sample questions might include:

          How would you describe a typical week/day in this position?
          Is this a new position? If not, what did the previous employee go on to do?
          How would you describe the company’s management style?
          Who does this position report to? If I am offered the position, can I meet him/her?
          How many people work in this office/department?
          Is travel expected in this position? If so, how much?
          What are the prospects for growth and advancement?
          What would you say are the best things about working here?
          Would you like a list of references?
          If I am extended a job offer, how soon would you like me to start?

          At the end of an interview, thank the interviewer for their time and ask them about next steps and when you can expect to hear back from them.</div>
