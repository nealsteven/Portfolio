    <p>So, you want to learn a little about me? You came to the right place. I'm shy, quiet, and ___________. Hey, wait that doesn't like what you wanted to hear. Even though I'm those things I also like to have fun and work hard. I'm expanding my skill set each and every day. I'm excited to take on greater challenges whatever they may be. As I've gotten older I've gone through multiple jobs. My favorite was roofing however it was taking to much of a toll on my body. Roofing has taught me the most about being a hard worker and never to give up. I also enjoy sitting down and working with computers. With that said, I plan  on getting my degree in computing from Florida State College at Jacksonville. In hopes that I can get a job at an awesome company doing the work that I enjoy. I'm trying to perfect my skills of creating creative, appealing, usable, websites using the latest W3C web standards guidelines and everything I learned about web development. Currently, I'm teaching myself, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and photo editing for web development. When I'm not in front of my computer studying design and development. You'll find me in playing disc golf, volunteering, traveling somewhere with my friends, writing (I have written a couple of small articles). I'm also a huge gamer.</p>

        <h2>Get to know me through my impossible list:</h2>
        <p>The Impossible List is a list of very audacious goals that I never could imagine myself accomplishing, yet I strive to do just that. I owe the credit to <a href="http://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/" class="links1">Thomas Frank</a> who I discovered it through, but he was inspired by <a href="http://joelrunyon.com/two3/the-impossible-list" class="links1">Joel Runyon</a> who explains what the Impossible List is:</p>
      </div>      
    </div>        
<div class="container">  
  <blockquote>
  The impossible list is NOT a bucket list. Not too long ago, I used to settle for the possible things in life. The sure thing. It was “realistic”, “safe” and boring as hell. I decided I needed a challenge.


  The impossible list is that challenge. This list of impossible things contains all the things I ever thought I couldn’t do because it was “impossible.” The sort of things that I assumed the cool guys on TV only ever got to do. The things I never thought that I would be able to do. <footer>Joel Runyon</footer>
