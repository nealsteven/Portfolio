      <h1><strong>What is powder coating?</strong></h1>
      <p>
        &emsp;Powder coating is the process of applying a paint in the form of powder. Regular paints are made up of pigment, resin, solvent, additives and binders. Powder coating is just the dry pigments and binders. Once the powder is sprayed on your workpiece, it must be &#8220;baked&#8221; according to the type of coating that you use. Each powder has a different curing time and temperature and you should follow that schedule.
      </p>
      <h2>
	Can you powder coat over rust?
</h2>
      <p>
        &emsp;The simple answer is yes but should you? No. The long answer is powder coating over rust is not a good idea. If you do eventually the rust will bleed through the powder coating. Once that happens the powder coating will no longer have a strong bond to the object and fall off. Also, powder coating doesn&#8217;t seal against rust in any way. If there&#8217;s any rust underneath the coating, it will grow and eat away the metal. If rust is present on your workpiece and the phosphate coating is applied, it may be uneven or spotty. If the phosphate coating is uneven of spotty the powder coating won&#8217;t adhere to the metal like it should or no adhesion to the surface of the workpiece. If you look at the steps below you can see it is very important to have your workpiece cleaned off. If there is something that is on the metal that wasn&#8217;t there originally it will/needs to be removed.
      </p>
      <h2>
	Steps to get powder coating done.
</h2>
      <p>These steps so that it&#8217;s necessary to have all foreign contaminates cleaned off of your workpiece.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Disassembly (at home) - Powder coating will not stay on rubber, plastic, gaskets, wiring, etc.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cleaning (at home) - Remove all dirt, oil, grease, and grime from the product by using a degreaser that is safe for the type of metal you are powder coating.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Stripping (at the shop) &#8211; With the use of a chemical stripper. Remove any previous coatings whether it be paint, powder coat, or anything else.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Outgassing (optional, at the shop) - the process of pre-baking the part in the oven at a higher temperature and longer time period than the actual powder coat curing.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Sandblasting or Phosphate Coating (at the shop)- Sandblasting will clean your part to clean bare metal while providing a texture to the part which allows the powder coating to adhere to.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Post-Sandblast Cleaning (at the shop) - Sandblasting will remove almost all contaminates from your workpiece. However, your part will come out covered in sandblasting debris and will need to be cleaned with a solvent.</li>
        <br>
      </ul>

      <p>There are more steps, but those are for the prep instructions for powder coating.</p>
      <h2>
	So do you still want to powder coat over rust?
</h2>
      <p>
        &emsp;I sure hope not. After reading this article, I hope it changed your mind. A little prep can go a long way. Powder coating is the last step to your workpiece before you show it off so make sure it&#8217;s done correctly. And remember if you are powder coating at home. The process involves some hazard to persons and property.
