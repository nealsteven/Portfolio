    <h1><strong>Ad-blockers</strong></h1>
<p>
    So what is an ad-blocker? It is a program that blocks all of the ads on a website. There are a couple of exceptions to that rule. There are ads that are
    considered acceptable and there is an option to turn off the ad-blocker on certain sites. There are many benefits about running an ad-blocker, but there is
    one main drawback. There are many ad-blockers on the market today and all do the same basic thing.
</p>
<h1>
    Benefits of ad-blockers
</h1>
<p>
    The major benefit is that there are a lot less "annoying" ads loading on the screen and that makes it easier to focus on what is being searched for. With
    the use of ad-blockers, it is making the advertisers produce better ads. Ads became so flashy trying to gain the attention of the user that it took away
    from the user experience. This started the Acceptable Ads Initiative (this improves the quality of ads). Ad effectiveness has also been geared towards
    creating more acceptable ads. There are a couple of "regulations" for acceptable ads: 1. The ad can't be bothersome; 2. They can't obtrude or distort the
    content on the website that is loaded; 3. They must be honest and open about being an ad; 4. They are required to be suitable for the site. In addition to
    the Acceptable Ads Initiative, there is also the Digital Advertising Alliance, which sets standards about tracking. The DAA mandates that advertisers and
    publishers reveal what data is collected. It also asks that advertisers to build a very easy way to opt out of tracking altogether. Most large publishers
    now require advertisers to agree with DAA guidelines.
</p>
<h1>
    Ad-blockers for security
</h1>
<p>
    Some people utilize ad-blockers for security. Even though they don't know what or how much info is being used about them for targeted ads. Many people
    don't realize that ads could also be infected with malware (malicious code that can damage the computer) this is called Malvertising. There is plenty of
    advertising so it's hard to tell the good from the bad. Some advertisements bring the user to a different site that has all of the malware and viruses.
    According to Norton Internet Security, a popular ploy directs the user to an infected site where a screen pops up showing that an antivirus scan has found
    viruses on the user’s computer. The user is directed to “click here” to remove the virus. Instead, clicking loads the malware onto the
    <br/>
    user’s computer. (Boatman, n.d.)
</p>
    <br>

    <img class="center-block"

  </div>
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
    Furthermore, ad fraud is another security reason people use an ad-blocker. Ad fraud is the practice of attempting to serve ads that have no possibility to
    be seen by a human. Some say ad fraud is contributing to $7 billion in wasteful ad spending annually. Ad fraud works by having websites with pirated
    content on them that are Malvertising. These sites the use the malicious code then takes over a computer (these computers being ran by the malware are
    considered bots) with ads. The ads bring the user’s computer to the fake site and gets ad views from the computer. It repeatedly does this to make money
    off the ads that are displayed. Bots, use automated computer programs to fake click ads, are about half of ad publishers traffic.
</p>
<p>
    With ads keeping such a strong track of regular purchases and sites visited. They accumulate plenty of data about the consumer. This is alarming to know
    because both cyber-criminals and the government have proven that they can get a hold of the information we thought was secured. Ad-blocker inadvertently
    helps prevent this from happening by keeping that information from ever being stored online.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, that tracking doesn't stop online. There are companies that track customers offline shopping and sells it to create online ads. There are
    four major companies that do this. They are Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai. Each company does this in a slightly different way. Most of the
    companies get their information from store loyalty cards, warranty cards, and whenever an email, phone number or name is entered on a sign-up form.
    Datalogix collects their data by monitoring sales of different companies. Epsilon has a list on their website of the companies they get data from. Acxiom
    has companies go to their site and upload the information about their consumers. BlueKai has a program called Data-Driven Action for Smarter Sales (DDASS).
    It's like Acxiom and has the businesses upload the information to them. Now Datalogix has partnered with Facebook. So the ads on Facebook are a combination
    of Datalogix's information (Emails, phone numbers and Datalogix IDs) and Facebook's information. For a better look at this

    . There is a way to opt out of being a target.

<h1>
    Page speed and data usage
</h1>
<p>
    At the moment, a relatively small portion of users are blocking ads on mobile devices. On the computer, that is a different story. 126 million chrome
    users, 48 million Firefox users and 9 million Safari users are running an ad-blocker program in 2015. This will change, though since Apple is introducing
    an ad-blocker in the iOS9 update. Also, with the issue of malicious apps on Google's, Apple's and third-party app stores will drive up the use of ad
    blockers on mobile devices. More and more apps are ad driven so it is easy for the malicious code to be installed on mobile devices. With ad-blockers
    active some sites and games will load faster (depending on how many ads were on the site/ game). If using a mobile device, there can be less data usage and
an improvement in battery life. There has been one test showing that this was true. It is    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="links1">located here</a>. Some sites are
    slower because the ad-blocker has to load and those sites already don’t have a lot of ads on them.
</p>
<h1>
    Drawbacks of ad-blockers
</h1>
<p>
    What many people don't realize is the impact ad-blockers hold on the future of the web. Both with advertising and the amount of money being lost. Most
    sites are free and contain a bountiful quantity of convenient content. As a result of using ad-blockers, some websites are losing money and that means jobs
    are being cut. Ad-blockers prevent websites from acquiring ad revenue, the main source of income for most sites. Most people assume the only way an ad pays
    out is to click the ad, but that's not the case with some ads. There are some ads that get paid less than a cent every time the ad is shown on a site.
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo Mail users were greeted with a notice: "Please disable Ad-Blocker to continue using Yahoo Mail." These users were incapable of accessing their
    accounts until they removed their ad-blocker or found a workaround for the dilemma. This message is not a new policy, but was part of a trial, a Yahoo
    spokesman told Engadget over the weekend. A "small number" of Yahoo Mail users were prevented from accessing their email accounts because Yahoo detected,
    they had an ad-blocker installed on their computer. The message was most likely a result of an A/B test, a technique technology companies push changes to a
    small number of users to measure user reaction before deploying them universally
</p>
<p>
    Web sites that depend on advertising income are increasingly locking out users if they pick to use an ad-blocker. Yahoo joins The Washington Post and Hulu
    as part of the growing catalog of websites that block users with ad-blockers. Some sites are forced to start charging for content. Online TV streaming
    service Hulu, presents consumers the choice between viewing one long ad or various ads broken up and the ability to select one out of three ads to see. One
    website conducted a 12-hour test to see if they could make certain content vanish for visitors to the site that were using an ad blocker. The code that
    they wrote to perform this was a success. Ad-blockers couldn't see the content. Other sites, including NFL team sites, The Guardian, and The Atlantic also
    detect ad-blockers, but instead they just ask users to donate money to the site or turn off their ad-blockers. The impact on sites related to gaming have
    the most visitors likely to block advertising content, followed by social media sites, tech/Internet-themed sites, education, and then sports. These sites
    have to fight harder to make money with having the most users using an ad-blocker. Then there are the sites with the least visitors with ad-blockers, government/legal sites.

    ad-blocker.
